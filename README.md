The impact of vaccination on the emergence of new strains- SIR model

Welcome everyone !
Here is the code I computed for my master thesis at the universities of Fribourg and Berne in Switzerland for the master of Science in Bioinformatics and Computational Biology.

The goal of my work is to understand how the vaccination strategy can influence the emergence of new strain. "link text"
I computated a Kermack Mc Kendrick model where we can vary the vaccintion rate (number of people vaccinated per unit of time), the number of people that will be vaccinted at the end of the spread, the efficiently of the vaccine and the virulence of the mutant. 

The library used are : DeSolve (1.33), reshape2 (1.4.4), tidyverse (1.3.1) and RColorBrewer (1.1-3)
